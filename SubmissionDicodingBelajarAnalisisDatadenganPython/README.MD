# Overview: Bike Rentals Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the Bike Rentals Data Analytics project repository! This project is the culmination of my learning journey in the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course offered by Dicoding. The main objective of this project is to perform in-depth analysis and create an interactive dashboard using the bike sharing dataset.

## Project Details:

- **Dataset:** 
  The dataset used in this project contains information about bike rentals, including details such as rental duration, start and end times, user types, and more.

- **Analysis Process:**
  The analysis process is divided into three main stages:
  1. **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.
     - **Gathering data**
     - **Assessing data**
     - **Cleaning data**
  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using statistical and visualization techniques.
     - **Defined business questions for data exploration**
     - **Create Data exploration**
  3. **Data Visualization:** Creating visual representations of the data to communicate findings effectively.
     - **Create Data Visualization that answer business questions**
  4. **Dashboard:** Setting up the DataFrame which will be used, making filter components on the dashboard, and completing the dashboard with various data visualizations.

## Project Work Cycle:

The project follows the following work cycle:

1. **Data Wrangling:**
   - Gathering data
   - Assessing data
   - Cleaning data

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Defining business questions for data exploration
   - Creating Data exploration

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Creating Data Visualization that answer business questions

4. **Dashboard:**
   - Setting up the DataFrame which will be used
   - Making filter components on the dashboard
   - Completing the dashboard with various data visualizations

## Getting Started:

### notebook.ipynb
1. Download this project.
2. Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but in here I will use Google Colab).
3. Create a New Notebook.
4. Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
5. Connect to hosted runtime.
6. Lastly, run the code cells.

### dashboard/dashboard.py
1. Download this project.
2. Install Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using `pip install streamlit`. Install other libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
3. Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts as a data source. Keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
4. Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it `streamlit run dashboard.py`.
